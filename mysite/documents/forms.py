Testing for multipart forms

If youâ€™re writing reusable views or templates,
you may not know ahead of time whether your form is a multipart form or not.
The is_multipart() method tells you whether the form requires multipart encoding
for submission:

Form.is_multipart()
>>> f = ContactFormWithMugshot()
>>> f.is_multipart()
True

template sample

{% if form.is_multipart %}
    <form enctype="multipart/form-data" method="post" action="/foo/">
{% else %}
    <form method="post" action="/foo/">
{% endif %}
{{ form }}
</form>
